They provide links to specific PRs that have been open for a long time without being merged. The author mentions that acceptable BIPs have become more limited, excluding mempool/relay policy. They also note that only one of the two editors, Luke, seems to be able to assign new numbers to BIPs.\n\nThe author further points out delays caused by the editors wanting backward compatibility sections in BIPs, even if the authors don't think it is necessary. They discuss the confusion surrounding the decision to allow markdown as a text format. The author describes the BIPs repository as having high friction, though not completely dysfunctional.\n\nTo address these issues, the author introduces a dedicated \"IANA\"-ish thing called Binana, independent of the BIP process. They provide a link to the Binana repository and invite people to use it for Bitcoin-related proposals. The author mentions they will apply the policies they believe the BIPs repo should use and invites others to open a PR, even if they disagree with the author's opinion. The author mentions the possibility of someone creating an automatic-merge-bot or reforming the BIPs repo itself. They sign off, noting that the name \"numbers and names\" is mainly for amusement but could serve as an authoritative dictionary for certain terms.",

They mention that there are no cluster limits, but these transactions are treated as if they have a maximum cluster size of 2. The author also mentions that this policy enables other features and provides links for further reading. There is also mention of a code coverage report and a guideline for the review process. The author acknowledges that conflicting pull requests need to be reviewed and suggests adding fuzzing for the new policy rules. They also mention making changes to the code to address issues raised in reviews and tests, such as checking the maximum sigops and updating documentation. The author discusses scenarios related to pinning and proposes improvements to make pinning harder to exploit. They mention that the code has been well reviewed and tested and should be ready for merging. However, there are objections and debates regarding the LN spec and the resiliency of the mitigation. The author emphasizes the importance of addressing security concerns and suggests delaying the release if consensus is not reached. They also mention the risk of rushing a project and causing major failures.

The author hopes that their disclosure will inspire lightning node operators to upgrade to a safer version. They also believe it is important to inform the community about historical attacks on lightning.\nThe author provided an example involving two malicious nodes, M1 and M2, connected through another node, B. They discussed how the attacker can delay transactions by a specific amount of time (CLTV delta) to increase the chances of a successful attack. They mentioned that the default configuration of bitcoind limits the number of connections, which may protect some implementations. The author also shared two pull requests related to peer order processing and protecting the last outbound HB compact block peer.\nThey mentioned that running a non-listening node can make these types of attacks more difficult and suggested running multiple listening nodes as a potential solution.",

      "summary": "The author discusses two new experiments, Superposition and Note-Duel, that have been built with Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs). Superposition is a DLC oracle app where users can create and attest to events. These events and the signed attestations are published on nostr, making it easy to discover and use them. Smart contracts can be created based on the outcome of these events, and anyone can check the reputation of the oracle before relying on their events. Note-Duel is a demo app that allows users to wager a nostr \"note\" on the outcome of a Superposition. The winning and losing notes are published on the respective profiles. DLCs use cryptographic enforcement and can be used for social betting or more significant applications like fact-checking. The author highlights the need for discoverability in DLCs, and the emergence of nostr as a global broadcast system that validates using schnorr signatures. The ultimate goal is to build DLC functionality into Mutiny and enable self-sovereign, private, and intuitive DLCs for actual money. Currently, on-chain DLCs are the most mature, providing privacy and security, but the plan is to also incorporate Fedimint for smaller and more private bets. The author also mentions that a Discreet Log Contracts over Nostr spec has been proposed, and the frontends for Note Duel and Superposition are open-source NPM packages. The author expresses excitement about the future of DLCs and hopes to see the ecosystem flourish.",

      "summary": "Apple is making changes to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union (EU). These changes affect developers' apps in the EU and include new options for app distribution, payment processing, browser engines, interoperability, and more. These changes are available to developers who distribute apps in any of the 27 EU member countries and only apply to apps available and distributed to EU users. Existing developers who want to continue operating as usual do not need to take any action.\nApple's goal is to create a safe and secure user experience while complying with the requirements of the DMA. However, these changes may increase risks such as malware, fraud, scams, and privacy threats. Apple is introducing protections, including notarization for iOS apps, authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments, to mitigate these risks. However, some risks still remain.\nDevelopers can access these options through the beta release of Xcode 15.3 and iOS 17.4, with the changes becoming available to users in the EU starting in March 2024. Apple is also introducing new business terms for apps in the EU to reflect the DMA's requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. Developers can choose to adopt these new terms or remain on Apple's existing terms.\nTo distribute apps through alternative app marketplaces, developers need to evaluate the marketplace's offering and terms and conditions. They also need to contact the marketplace developer to receive a security token required for alternative distribution. Apple has introduced Notarization for iOS apps, which checks apps for malware and viruses. Apps distributed through alternative marketplaces will require encryption and signing by Apple to protect developers' intellectual property and ensure users get apps from known parties.\nTo comply with the DMA's changes, users in the EU will be able to install apps from alternative app marketplaces, choose their default web browser, and use alternative browser engines. Apple has also introduced new default controls for users to manage payment methods and default settings for apps and web browsers.\nThe DMA's changes also expand app analytics available to developers and introduce new reports to help developers analyze their app performance. Developers can access these reports through the App Store Connect API.\nApple has designed new business terms that reflect the DMA's changes and provide choices for developers. These business terms include a Core Technology Fee (CTF) for developers whose apps reach exceptional scale. Apple estimates that less than 1% of developers will pay the CTF. Developers can use a fee calculator tool and new reports to estimate the potential impact of the new business terms on their app businesses.\nApple is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its EU users, but the DMA's changes introduce risks that cannot be completely eliminated. Apple has designed safeguards and protections to mitigate these risks while providing new capabilities and options for developers.

This \"offensive tool\" aims to disrupt AI models trained on images altered with Nightshade, causing them to misclassify objects. Nightshade v1.0 is the second tool from the Glaze Project team, following Glaze, which alters digital artwork to confuse AI training algorithms. Nightshade is compatible with Macs with Apple chips or PCs running Windows 10/11. The tool is resilient to common image alterations and can be used to increase the cost of training on unlicensed data, encouraging developers to pay artists for uncorrupted data.
