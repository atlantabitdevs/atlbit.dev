The key challenge in scaling Lightning is providing Lightning channels to casual users.

However, with covenants, a single UTXO can create a tree of transactions that create Lightning channels for millions of casual users. By using timeout-trees, casual users can rollover their funds from one timeout-tree to another without any action required, improving usability. These changes would enable Lightning to be widely used for payments.

The Signal Protocol was widely adopted after its publication in 2013. To advance quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol, an upgrade called PQXDH has been introduced. This upgrade adds a layer of protection against the threat of future powerful quantum computers that can break current encryption standards.\nThe post explains quantum computing and the challenges it presents for current cryptographic algorithms. The RSA Cryptosystem, a public key cryptosystem, is used as an example. RSA relies on a mathematical one-way function, which makes it computationally difficult to reverse the encryption. However, a future powerful quantum computer could break this encryption.\nTo address this problem, new post-quantum cryptosystems have been created. The protocol upgrade from X3DH to PQXDH computes a shared secret using both the elliptic curve key agreement protocol X25519 and the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism CRYSTALS-Kyber. By combining these two shared secrets, an attacker would need to break both systems to compute the shared secret.\nThe new protocol is already supported in Signal's client applications and will eventually be required for all new chats.

      "summary": "The article discusses Greenlight, a solution that aims to remove the trade-off between convenience and self-custody when using Lightning, a popular payment protocol for Bitcoin. Custodial solutions are easy to use but lack security and privacy guarantees, while non-custodial solutions require technical expertise. Greenlight reimagines the Lightning node by splitting it into smaller components. The client interface and signer run on the user's device, ensuring security and privacy, while the resource-intensive operational needs of the node are handled by Blockstream infrastructure. This allows businesses to focus on app development while offloading node operations. Greenlight also offers features such as scalability, API integration, and cost savings for developers. It is currently accessible through the Greenlight Developer Console, with both free and custom pricing plans available. For further information, users can visit the Blockstream blog or join the Greenlight community on Discord.",
