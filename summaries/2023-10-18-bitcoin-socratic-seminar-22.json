The key challenge in scaling Lightning is providing Lightning channels to casual users.

However, with covenants, a single UTXO can create a tree of transactions that create Lightning channels for millions of casual users. By using timeout-trees, casual users can rollover their funds from one timeout-tree to another without any action required, improving usability. These changes would enable Lightning to be widely used for payments.

The Signal Protocol was widely adopted after its publication in 2013. To advance quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol, an upgrade called PQXDH has been introduced. This upgrade adds a layer of protection against the threat of future powerful quantum computers that can break current encryption standards.\nThe post explains quantum computing and the challenges it presents for current cryptographic algorithms. The RSA Cryptosystem, a public key cryptosystem, is used as an example. RSA relies on a mathematical one-way function, which makes it computationally difficult to reverse the encryption. However, a future powerful quantum computer could break this encryption.\nTo address this problem, new post-quantum cryptosystems have been created. The protocol upgrade from X3DH to PQXDH computes a shared secret using both the elliptic curve key agreement protocol X25519 and the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism CRYSTALS-Kyber. By combining these two shared secrets, an attacker would need to break both systems to compute the shared secret.\nThe new protocol is already supported in Signal's client applications and will eventually be required for all new chats.

It is a lightweight and fast tool that generates rich previews of Nostr content, making it easy to share on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and Twitter. njump pages are static and can be indexed by search engines, helping others discover great content on Nostr. The gateway is not interested in capturing users and instead encourages them to \"jump\" to the Nostr resource using a list of web clients or native clients. njump also allows users to share their own profiles with a NIP-05 inspired permalink. Additionally, users can view the last content posted to a relay and toggle a \"Show more details\" switch to inspect the full event JSON.",
