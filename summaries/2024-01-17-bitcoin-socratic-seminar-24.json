They exploit a loophole in Bitcoin's anti-data-spam mechanisms and are not subjected to datacarriersize limits. This allows them to bypass restrictions on the size of data that can be relayed by noderunners and included in blocks. Inscriptions also take advantage of features in segwit v1 and v2/taproot, which were introduced for legitimate reasons. However, these features unintentionally made it cheap and easy to relay data, which is not the intended purpose of Bitcoin. People are attaching value to images stored on the blockchain and are willing to pay fees for it, but this is seen as an exploit by bitcoin developers who prioritize the health and decentralization of the network. Solutions need to be developed to address this data-spam issue.",

To prevent this, Bitcoin added a limit on the size of data that can be added. However, inscriptions have found a way around this limit by disguising data as Bitcoin script program data. This is seen as an exploit and needs to be fixed. Miners and people who value the images stored on the Bitcoin blockchain are willing to pay fees to include them, but this shouldn't be allowed.

Importantly, FiatLink is an open API standard, allowing any wallet or app to access multiple brokers through a single interface. This creates a more free and open market for fiat to bitcoin conversions. FiatLink will be integrated into the Breez SDK, giving app developers access to participating brokers. The technology includes a light-KYC fiat on-ramp, allowing users to buy bitcoin with minimal additional KYC requirements. The API fetches quotes on conversion rates from brokerages and users can request withdrawals through LNURL-Withdraw. Optional calls for wallet ownership verification and session ID assignment are also available. The development of FiatLink is based on feedback and collaboration with Swiss bitcoin brokerages like Relai and Pocket Bitcoin.",

The author expresses gratitude for the feedback received on the initial design and states that the spec has been updated to incorporate some changes based on that feedback. The author seeks early feedback on the usage of CLTV and the introduction of a new 'second stage' transaction to gate the leasor's funds during the lease. They provide a link to the updated proposal on GitHub.\n\nThe notable changes in the updated proposal are as follows:\n\n1. CSV to CLTV: The original proposal used a constantly updated block height (CSV) to lock up funds, but this created complexity and dependencies on anchor outputs. The new proposal switches to using CLTV locks on every output to the leasor to prevent access to funds before the lease period ends. A \"lease locked\" transaction is introduced to handle HTLCs in the leasee's commitment transaction.\n\n2. Variable Lease Terms: The lease length can now be specified by the node asking for the lease, allowing for more dynamic pricing. The channel fee cap commitments have been updated to specify a range of blocks for which the commitment is valid.\n\n3. Channel Fee Caps: The channel fee caps have been updated to be in increments of 100's of ppm (basis points), which is more granular than the previous 1k ppm range. The base msat cap is proposed to be reverted to a variable fee.\n\nThe author also mentions the inclusion of a fraud proof in the current proposal regarding channel fee commitments and asks for suggestions on how to enforce penalties for violating the commitments.\n\nThe author acknowledges various individuals for their contributions, reviews, and insights into the protocol.

      "summary": "Peerswaps is a technique that enables atomic swaps between the Lightning Network and Bitcoin or Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC). It offers a cost-effective and capital-efficient method for maintaining well-balanced Lightning channels. To perform a peerswap, users need to run the Peerswap daemon alongside their Lightning node (LND or CLN). Optionally, the Elements daemon can be run to use L-BTC. The Peerswap node acts as the swap coordinator, while the Elements node functions as a Liquid Bitcoin wallet. Peerswaps supports swapping on both the Bitcoin base chain and the Liquid Bitcoin federated sidechain, with Liquid Network offering advantages in terms of speed and cost. Peerswaps require direct swapping with channel partners who are running Peerswaps and have been whitelisted. The process involves initiating a peerswap using the Peerswap daemon, waiting for two confirmations on the Liquid network, and rebalancing the channel. Overall, Peerswaps provides a fast and cost-effective way to maintain balanced channels between direct channel peers.",
