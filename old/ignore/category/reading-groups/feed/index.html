<p>This session&#8217;s topic is the leaked Google memo&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;We Have No Moat&#8221;</a>. This document outlines the power of open source AI models and how businesses might stay competitive in the AI market.</p>



<p>While this isn&#8217;t a bitcoin focus paper, it is timely and relevant considering that the <a href="https://bolt.fun/tournaments/ai4all">AI4ALL hackathon</a> just launched. This hackathon has a clear focus on integrating bitcoin and lightning into AI applications. This document should help prepare your thinking for participating in this hackathon! Or if you don&#8217;t like to hack, it will at least be an interesting and fun conversation.</p>



<p>For those who many not have time to read the full paper, here is a summary provided by ChatGPT.</p>



<h2>Techie Summary</h2>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Can you summarize the keypoints of this article?</p>



<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> The blog post &#8220;We Have No Moat&#8221; discusses how open-source AI development is outpacing both the author&#8217;s organization and OpenAI, particularly in areas such as language learning models (LLMs).</p>



<p>Key points include:</p>



<ol><li><strong>The Rise of Open-Source AI:</strong> Open-source AI development has rapidly advanced, solving many &#8220;major open problems&#8221; in the field. People are running foundation models on mobile devices, fine-tuning personalized AI models on laptops in an evening, and freely sharing models with no restrictions. The quality gap between corporate and open-source models is closing fast.</li><li><strong>No Secret Sauce:</strong> The author&#8217;s organization and OpenAI lack a competitive edge over open-source AI, as these projects are quicker, more versatile, and generally more capable. The organization&#8217;s best hope is collaboration with the broader community.</li><li><strong>Leak of Meta’s LLaMA Model:</strong> An open-source foundation model from Meta was leaked to the public, resulting in a wave of innovation. Variants of this model were quickly developed, showcasing the reduced barrier to entry and power of collective development.</li><li><strong>Lessons Missed:</strong> Several innovations, such as LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation), which allows for model fine-tuning at a fraction of the cost and time, were not adequately considered by Google. Furthermore, the blog suggests that training smaller models and iterating them quickly could be more beneficial in the long run than training larger models from scratch.</li><li><strong>The Impact of Data Quality Over Quantity:</strong> Projects that train on small, highly curated datasets often save time and show promising results. This approach contradicts traditional data scaling laws.</li><li><strong>Direct Competition with Open-Source is a Losing Game:</strong> With the rise of open-source AI, there&#8217;s little incentive for customers to pay for restricted Google products. Open-source development holds advantages, like breadth of research and individual freedom from licenses, which cannot be replicated by corporations.</li><li><strong>Importance of Ecosystem Ownership:</strong> The blog post highlights how Meta benefited from the leak of their model, as most open-source innovations build upon their architecture. This positions Meta to incorporate these advancements directly into their products, underlining the value of owning the ecosystem. The author suggests that Google should similarly aim to own and control the ecosystem.</li></ol>



<h2>Non-techie Summary</h2>



<p><strong>Me: </strong>Thanks! This works well for somebody who is familiar with tech. Could you summarize again in a way that&#8217;s about half the length, and geared towards an adult who is interested in tech, but doesn&#8217;t follow the AI industry closely and may not be familiar with AI industry jargon?</p>



<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, here&#8217;s a simplified summary:</p>



<p>The blog post, &#8220;We Have No Moat,&#8221; discusses how people working on AI in their own free time or in smaller, more open groups are moving ahead of big organizations like the writer&#8217;s own and OpenAI.</p>



<p>Key points include:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Open-Source AI Rising:</strong> These open-source, or publicly accessible projects, are making great strides in AI technology, even allowing people to run advanced AI models on everyday devices like phones and laptops.</li><li><strong>Big Organizations Losing Edge:</strong> The author admits that big organizations like theirs and OpenAI don&#8217;t hold a significant advantage over these open-source projects anymore. They suggest collaborating with the broader community.</li><li><strong>Power of Collective Development:</strong> A powerful AI model from the company Meta was made public, and this sparked a wave of innovation as people around the world built upon it.</li><li><strong>Fast Improvements on Smaller AI Models:</strong> The author suggests that creating smaller AI models and improving them quickly could be more effective than spending a lot of time and resources on creating larger models from scratch.</li><li><strong>Quality of Data Over Quantity:</strong> Projects using smaller, carefully selected sets of data are saving time and showing promising results.</li><li><strong>Open-Source Outpaces Big Organizations:</strong> With the rise of open-source AI, it&#8217;s difficult for big companies to compete. The open-source community holds advantages that big companies can&#8217;t match, like a wide range of research and individual freedom.</li><li><strong>Importance of Controlling the Ecosystem:</strong> The author emphasizes how Meta benefited from the open-source work based on their AI model, suggesting that controlling the platform where this innovation occurs can be very valuable.</li></ol>

<p>We&#8217;re <a href="https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/290912698/">meeting tonight</a> to discuss the <a href="https://lightningprivacy.com/en/routing-analysis">Routing Analysis</a> chapter of <a href="https://lightningprivacy.com/en/introduction">Lightning Privacy Research</a>. Here are some notes to help prepare you for the discussion!</p>



<p>NOTE: This is just Stephen sharing his notes with you and not actually a well thought-out or spellchecked instructional plan. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f643.png" alt="🙃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2>Lightning Privacy Introduction</h2>



<p><a href="https://lightningprivacy.com/en/introduction">https://lightningprivacy.com/en/introduction</a></p>



<ul><li>Bitcoin Layer 1 &#8211; all TXes visible on a public blockchain</li><li>Lightning (Layer 2) &#8211; No central ledger, peer-to-peer</li></ul>



<h3>Problems</h3>



<ul><li>When a LN payment is associated with a BTC TX</li><li>P2P LN nodes know certain payment details</li><li>Highly connected LN nodes see a larger percent of network</li></ul>



<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;Questions</h3>



<p>What is an anonymity set?</p>



<h2>Routing Analysis</h2>



<p><a href="https://lightningprivacy.com/en/routing-analysis">https://lightningprivacy.com/en/routing-analysis</a></p>



<ul><li>LN uses onion routing for a certain amount of source and destination privacy</li></ul>



<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;Questions</h3>



<p>How is LN onion routing similar to TOR? How is it different?</p>



<ul><li>Problem statement &#8211; there’s situations where the sender and receiver can be learned by routing nodes<ul><li>Some scenarios allow routers to infer this info</li><li>A single actor controlling multiple nodes can correlate payment info</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;Questions</h3>



<p>What is an LSP? How might using an LSP affect privacy?</p>



<ul><li>HTLCs &#8211; using the same payment hash each time can affect privacy</li><li>Wormhole attack &#8211; allows dishonest users to steal routing fees from honest users along a payment path &#8211; outlined in this paper: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472.pdf"></a><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472.pdf</a><ul><li>Basically, 2 malicious nodes (Mike and Mallory) are on the same payment route and collaborate</li><li>Normal behavior: nodes pass the preimage back to the prior node to unwind HTLCs</li><li>Evil behavior: Mike passes preimage back to Mallory, skipping all the nodes in between, and M &amp; M take the routing fees of every node that was skipped</li></ul></li><li>PTLCs might fix this<ul><li>PTLCs explained on SuredBits &#8211; <a href="https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/#references"></a><a href="https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/#references">https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/#references</a></li></ul></li><li>Timing delays &#8211; basically, estimating how far away source of destination of a payment is by how long it takes to settle<ul><li>Top nodes can perform timing analysis on the majority of payments <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12143.pdf"></a><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12143.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12143.pdf</a></li><li>What if you run multiple nodes, and you route a payment for amount X, and then milliseconds later your other nodes routes a payment for slightly less than amount X.</li><li>What if average payment time between your node and neighbor is 100ms? If you route a payment to tyour neighbor and the HTLC or PTLC is fulfilled in about 100ms, you can assume your neighbor was the final hop.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;Questions</h3>



<p>Should nodes add a random delay to fix timing analysis? It must be 2-3x delay to be meaningful, but does this affect usability of the LN? (See Peter Todd’s comment on <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-June/003621.html">opting into slower payments for the sake of privacy</a>)</p>



<ul><li>Random delay could be neat, but isn’t enforceable</li><li>MPP &#8211; Multipath payments</li><li>Randomize them to improve them</li><li>Multipath improves privacy</li><li>Randomizing the multipath and multiple shards to each node improves further</li><li>Splinter payments &#8211; MPP initiates midway through route</li><li>Splinter is theoretical atm<ul><li>Protocol change needed?</li><li>Can splintering be enforced?</li></ul></li><li>Longer paths?<ul><li>6 degress of sep</li><li>Go beyond 9 hops</li></ul></li><li>Analyzing multipath payments<ul><li>Less info can be gleaned (dont know full payment amount)</li><li>Anonymity set increases if more folks use MPP<ul><li>Thought to self: reminds of CoinJoins in a way. Could people route MPPs with preset denominations to improve privacy?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2753.png" alt="❓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;Questions</h3>



<ul><li>What are positives for implementing the author’s suggestions?</li><li>What are negatives for these suggestions?</li><li>Implementation notes<ul><li>PTLCs &#8211; no progress has been made since taproot softfork</li><li>Timing delays &#8211; no active work being done to the knowledge of the authors</li><li>MPP is possible today. Splintering has not been discussed before.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>We<a href="https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/290298846/"> met up on January 4</a> to talk about the bitcoin genesis block. Here are Stephen&#8217;s notes he prepared for the discussion group.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Yesterday marked the 14th anniversary of the bitcoin genesis block, which is timestamped January 3, 2009.</p>



<h2>What is a genesis block?</h2>



<p>A genesis block is the first block in a blockchain. It&#8217;s unique because it does not reference a previous block and because it is typically hardcoded into node software. Bitcoin&#8217;s genesis block has several more unique qualities.</p>



<h3>Questions</h3>



<p>Why <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/133/tree/trunk/main.cpp#l1613">hardcode</a> it into the software?</p>



<h2>Let&#8217;s look at the bitcoin genesis block</h2>



<p>You can find the genesis block in a block explorer by searching for &#8220;0&#8221;. Here it is on <a href="https://mempool.space/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f">mempool.space</a>.</p>



<h3>Questions</h3>



<p>What are some unique qualities to this block? <em>Hint: you don&#8217;t have to be too technical to notice, just look at the <a href="http://mempool.space">mempool.space</a> page.</em></p>



<h3>Fun Fact</h3>



<p>Bitcoin signet and Bitcoin testnet both share the same unique feature in their genesis blocks, however, the block hashes are different.</p>



<h2>How do we know when the genesis block was mined?</h2>



<p>The timestamp would be sufficient in a trusted scenario, but this is bitcoin. The message in the coinbase transaction helps us to know that it would be impossible to mine the block <em>before</em> January 3, 2009. However, we don&#8217;t have precise evidence that it was mined on this date exactly.</p>



<ul><li>October 31, 2008 &#8211; Satoshi <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">released the Bitcoin whitepaper</a> to the <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/thread.html">Cryptography mailing list</a>.</li><li>January 8, 2009 &#8211; Satoshi <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html">releases Bitcoin v0.1</a> to the <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/thread.html">Cryptography mailing list</a>.</li><li>January 9, 2009 &#8211; Satoshi <a href="https://mempool.space/block/000000006a625f06636b8bb6ac7b960a8d03705d1ace08b1a19da3fdcc99ddbd">mines more blocks</a></li><li>January 10, 2009 &#8211; <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html">Hal Finney responds on the mailing list</a> and makes <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988">the now famous tweet</a></li></ul>



<h3>Question</h3>



<p>Why is it that there is a 6 day gap between block 0 and block 1?</p>



<p>Nobody knows for certain, but there are theories:</p>



<ul><li>Satoshi was inspired by the Times headline, and mined the first block with a timestamp in the past to match the headline.</li><li>Satoshi had difficulty mining the first block and so he had to mine the first block for 6 days, but kept the timestamp and message persistent through all the attempts.</li><li>Satoshi mined it on Jan 3, then spent the next 6 days testing the bitcoin software and network. He then trashed the test blocks and started fresh, re-using the January 3 genesis block (this is called the <em>prenet hypothesis</em>).</li></ul>



<h3>Mysteries</h3>



<p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.0">In this bitcointalk.org post</a>, Sergio Demian Lerner (future creator of the RSK sidechain) comments on some of this. He reasons that Satoshi likely used a single CPU. He also points out that the genesis block has a higher difficulty (43 zero bits instead of the 32 difficulty at the time) and he calculates that if Satoshi mined for 6 days, he would have a 17% chance of mining this block. Why did Satoshi opt for this higher difficulty? Did he get lucky? Did he use some massive computing infrastructure? If so, why only use it on the first block? (This user, however, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.msg59136085#msg59136085">disputes that the extra leading zeroes are significant</a>).</p>



<p>Sergio also points out that there is no routine in Satoshi&#8217;s source code for generating a genesis block. Therefore, Satoshi was using some other software to mine the block, though we don&#8217;t know how different it was. Perhaps it was a custom script written entirely for the purpose of mining the genesis block, or perhaps he simply modified the main client&#8217;s source code temporarily to mine the first block.</p>



<h3>Prior work</h3>



<p>Interestingly, Satoshi had actually been fiddling with the genesis back as far back as 2008. This <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=382374.0;all">man on bitcointalk.org shares some early bitcoin source code</a> which Satoshi shared with him on November 16, 2008, a mere 2 weeks after the release of the whitepaper. You can go back to the mailing list to find <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014863.html">Satoshi discussing how he had been working on the source code for the past year and a half</a>, and he mentions how he will share the &#8220;main files&#8221; with you by request.</p>



<h2>Satoshi&#8217;s bitcoin</h2>



<p>The genesis block coinbase tx spent to this address: <code><em>1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa</em></code></p>



<p>You can see the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa">address balance here</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, the output is unspendable. This is because of how the bitcoin client is coded. Bitcoin Core maintains a block database and a transaction database, distinct from the raw block data stored on disk. If it starts up and finds the block database empty, it insert the hardcoded genesis block data. However, it skips adding the genesis coinbase to the transactions database.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10009/why-can-t-the-genesis-block-coinbase-be-spent">Charles Hoskinson explains on Bitcoin StackExchange</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nc13r/the_first_50btc_block_reward_cant_be_spend_why/">Theymos explains on Reddit</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9546a977d354b2ec6cd8455538e68fe4ba343a44/src/main.cpp#L1668">Code that skips the genesis TX</a></li></ul>



<p>Was this an accidental oversight? Or did Satoshi feel it wasn&#8217;t fair to claim these coins since he mined them as the only network participant?</p>



<p>Nobody knows, as Satoshi disappeared before anyone noticed this quirk of the genesis coinbase.</p>



<p>It is believed that other outputs belonging to this address are spendable, assuming that Satoshi has the private key to this address. Even that is not known.</p>



<h3>Wait, other outputs?</h3>



<p>To this day, people are <a href="https://mempool.space/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa">still sending outputs</a> to the genesis address to this day as tribute. Maybe <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.msg1790293#msg1790293">bitcoin is a religion</a>?</p>



<h2>So who was Satoshi?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting that in a comment <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/9773/how-do-you-make-a-genesis-block">on this Stack post,</a> Bitcoin Core dev Pieter Wiulle remarks:</p>



<p><em>&gt; Even though the Genesis block (almost) satisfies all rules that other blocks have to satisfy (and even more, see <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.0"><u>bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172009.0</u></a>), it is not actually validated by full nodes. It&#8217;s just a hardcoded starting point, and it would actually have worked just as well if it did not carry any proof of work.</em></p>



<p>Did Satoshi know this and decide to mine the block anyway to send a message or set some kind of precedent? Or was this an oversight, making him only human?</p>



<p>A scientist named Jens Ducrée wrote<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10257.pdf"> this scholarly article</a> diving into a lot of circumstantial evidence about the identity of Satoshi. Did the Satoshi live in the UK, giving him early access to the Times print edition? Or did Satoshi have a close friend in the UK? Was he an individual genius or a team of people? Where did he go after disappearing on December 12, 2010?</p>



<p>But most importantly: does Jens know how to use the spellchecker or work with a proofreader?</p>



<h3>Question</h3>



<p>Why disappear?</p>

<p>Last year, a division of Block (formerly Square) known as <a href="https://twitter.com/tbd54566975">TBD54566975</a> released a whitepaper for a protocol called <em>tbDEX</em>. The goal seems to be to create a decentralized way of exchanging fiat for bitcoin, and vice-versa.</p>



<p>They launched the whitepaper in a blog post. For our next reading session, let&#8217;s discuss their <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">blog post</a>. This should be a nice, easy way to get into this topic before tackling the whitepaper. We&#8217;ll tackle the whitepaper itself in a future session.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to<a href="https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/283206504/"> seeing everyone next week for the BIP-119 reading group</a>. Here are some notes and resources to help you out.</p>



<h2>What are we reading?</h2>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4d9.png" alt="📙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki">BIP-119 by Jeremy Rubin</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This BIP proposes a new opcode, OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, to be activated as a change to the semantics of OP_NOP4.<br><br>The new opcode has applications for transaction congestion control and payment channel instantiation, among others, which are described in the Motivation section of this BIP.</p><cite><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki">From BIP-119</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2>How else can I follow along?</h2>



<p>If you are new to studying Bitcoin, find the document too difficult, or simply want some other contextual information, try these other sources instead. They will help you to follow along with the discussion.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png" alt="🎙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://stephanlivera.com/episode/339/">Jeremy Rubin on Stephan Livera&#8217;s podcast</a> &#8211; this entire episode is dedicated to Check Template Verify (BIP-119).</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4bb.png" alt="💻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://utxos.org/">UTXOs.org</a> &#8211; this is an informational website Jeremy put together which outlines the vision for BIP-119 and lays out examples for how it would be used.</p>



<h2>Questions to Consider</h2>



<p>See if you can find the answers to the questions. Some of the questions are targeted at beginners, while others are more advanced. Some answers you will find in the reading material, some you may have to conduct your own research for, and some require you to do some thinking and form your own opinion.</p>



<ul><li>What is a BIP?</li><li>Why do Bitcoin developers use BIPs? What would it look like if there were no BIPs?</li><li>What is a covenant? Should Bitcoin have covenants?</li><li>Do you think that &#8220;templates&#8221; are a good way to implement covenants in Bitcoin?</li><li>What are some of the use-cases for templates?</li><li>What are potential risks associated with this BIP?</li><li>What is a soft-fork?</li><li>What&#8217;s an argument for supporting this BIP?</li><li>What&#8217;s an argument for opposing this BIP?</li></ul>
