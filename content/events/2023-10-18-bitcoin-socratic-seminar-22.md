It‚Äôs almost time for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/296345921/">Bitcoin Socratic Seminar #22</a>!

## What is a Socratic Seminar?

Inspired by other BitDevs meetups around the US, our Socratic Seminar events
are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion.

1. Discussion topics are provided ahead of the event
2. The event moderator(s) leads the audience through the topics
3. Raise your hand to grab the mic and participate in the conversation
4. We go to a bar afterwards

## Logistics for Tonight

Due to a scheduling conflict with our hosts, we're not going to be at NCR. This time, we'll try a Socratic Seminar at ATL BitLab and see how it goes. If this is your first time attending a meetup at BitLab, follow these <a href="https://atlantabitdevs.org/parking-instructions-for-atl-bitlab/" target="_blank">parking instructions</a> and join our <a href="https://atlantabitdevs.org/telegram/" target="_blank">telegram channel</a> in case you need to ask for help finding us the night of the event.

[LDK PR #2413 - Blinded paths](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2413)¬†supports sending payments to¬†blinded paths¬†and allows receiving payments to paths where a single final hop is hidden (blinded) from the spender.

[LDK PR #2514 - other LDK blined paths stuff](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2514)

[LDK #2371](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2371)¬†adds support for managing payments using¬†offers. It allows a client application using LDK to use an offer to register its intent to pay an invoice, timing out the payment attempt if a sent offer never results in a received invoice, and then using existing code in LDK to pay the invoice (including retrying if the first attempts don‚Äôt succeed).
