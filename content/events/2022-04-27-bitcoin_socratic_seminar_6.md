It's almost time for [Bitcoin Socratic Seminar #6](https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/zdmtssydcgbbc/)!

## What is a Socratic Seminar?

Inspired by other BitDevs meetups around the US, our Socratic Seminar events
are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion.

  1. Discussion topics are provided ahead of the event
  2. The event moderator(s) leads the audience through the topics
  3. Raise your hand to grab the mic and participate in the conversation
  4. We go to a bar afterwards

First, [Bryan Nonni](https://twitter.com/btcbry) will go over some of the news
that you might have missed from the [Bitcoin 2022

Next, we'll have a discussion about bitcoin mining, energy, and the
environment. This topic concerns a lot of people but is very frequently
misunderstood. That's why we're bringing in bitcoiner and climate scientist
[Margot Paez](https://twitter.com/jyn_urso) to help us make sense of it. She
is a fellow at the [Bitcoin Policy Institute](https://www.btcpolicy.org/) and
a doctoral candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
