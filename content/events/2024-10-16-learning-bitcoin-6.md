We had a very informative talk from Jordan Bravo on how to use the Liquid sidechain. You can [find his presentation notes here](https://github.com/jordan-bravo/liquid-workshop/blob/master/README.md).

> As a sidechain of Bitcoin, Liquid allows you to move bitcoin (BTC) between the Bitcoin mainchain and the Liquid sidechain through a verifiable 1-to-1 peg.

> Bitcoin sidechains such as Liquid are blockchains that facilitate the transfer of assets to and from the Bitcoin mainchain via a two-way peg. The amount of BTC circulating on a sidechain is always verifiably equal to the amount of BTC “locked” on the Bitcoin mainchain.

> While sidechains are interoperable with the Bitcoin mainchain, they operate independently of the Bitcoin network itself. Sidechains depend on Bitcoin; Bitcoin does not depend on sidechains.
