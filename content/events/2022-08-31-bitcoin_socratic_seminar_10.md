This post was published retroactively. While we maintained a Socratic format
for this event, we mainly covered one topic, which was [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/). We also had a great opening talk about [Generation Bitcoin](https://genbitcoin.org/) from [Arsh](https://twitter.com/arshmolu).

Here is the deck we discussed during the Socratic portion:
